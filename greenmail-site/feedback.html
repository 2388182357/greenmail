	<td><i>"Hi,

I just wanted to thank you for offering GreenMail to the world. I just
finished plugging it into our application (replacing Dumbster) and found
it a breeze to use. I was a bit thrown by the requirement to set up a
user before using the IMAP server to avoid authentication exceptions. It
makes sense but can be a little confusing given the server is so
permissive otherwise. It might be an interesting feature to create an
account automatically if a user attempts to login but I guess this could
be problematic if you support negative testing for user logins.

We're using Spring so I hooked it into our application context so now
whenever we start the application we have a virtual IMAP/SMTP server we
can use for testing (aside from our unit testing where we are also using
it) from the UI.

Regards,

Rob"</i><p></td>
